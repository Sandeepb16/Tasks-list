<h1> Argentina </h1>
<p>Argentina,[a] officially the Argentine Republic,[b] is a country in the southern half of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America<a>. Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] making it the second-largest country in South America after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</a>, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. It shares the bulk of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cone">Southern Cone</a> with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation">federal state</a> subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and a part of Antarctica.<br><br>

The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist">federalist</a>, or to be an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism">federalism</a>. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France and Japan, for example, have been unitary for many centuries. The Austrian Empire was a unitary state with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_land#Austria">crown lands</a>, after the transformation into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> monarchy the remaining crown lands of so-called Cisleithania became federated as Länder of the Republic of Austria through the implementation of its constitution. Germany, with its 16 states, or Länder, and Nigeria, with its 36 states and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory_(Nigeria)">federal capital territory</a>, are examples of federations. Federations are often multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory (such as Russia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil, Pakistan or Australia), but neither is necessarily the case (such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or the Federated States of Micronesia)</p>
