<h1> AB de villiers </h1>
<p>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricketer</a>, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_ODI_Cricketer_of_the_Year">ICC ODI Player of the Year</a>[2] three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men%27s_ODI_Cricketer_of_the_Year">Wisden</a> cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.[4][5] De Villiers began his international career as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper-batsman</a>, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)">batting order</a>, but predominantly in the middle-order.

Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[6] He made his international debut in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket">Test match</a> against England in 2004 and first played a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International">One Day International (ODI)</a> in early 2005. His debut in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International">Twenty20 International</a> cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)">runs</a> in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)">batting average</a> of over fifty in both forms of the game.[7] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[8] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty (16 balls), fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest ODI 150 (62 balls).
